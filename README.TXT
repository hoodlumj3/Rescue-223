Hi,
   When I came to do Graphics Programming for my diploma, I decided to 
   do a game for my last assignment and HERE IT IS.
   
   All graphics & maps were done on my AMIGA 500 computer using MAPPED
   which I also wrote, not for the game mind you, but just because I
   wanted to write a Graphic/Map/Animation Editor on the AMIGA.
   
   This Whole game took over 3 months to produce, there are, unfortunatly,
   a few bugs in the game, like there is in my spelling, one day I shall
   get around to removing all undocumented features from the game, but 
   for now I shall keep developing my utilities on the AMIGA and IBM.
   
   This Game was inspired through Phill Whillier's Game "Freddy".
   Rescue only works on VGA machines.
   Was entirely written in Turbo C 2.0 with the screen handling functions
   written in assembley code, to be as fast as I could get them, although 
   I have found a way of getting them much faster than they currently are.

                       Instructions for "Rescue 223"
    
    - INSTALLATION -
    To install Rescue on hardrive change to a drive (type "a:") and type 
        "Install" <enter> at the DOS prompt.
    
    - EXECUTION -
    To run Rescue cd into the rescue directory on harddrive or floppy 
    and type 
        "rescue" <enter> at the DOS prompt.

    After a battle of the masses, Federation 223 became defeated by these
    small globes that just hover in a stationary position and fire in 
    all directions, All vehicles and weapons were absorbed by the intruders
    which left the workers of the Federation stranded and in need of 
    assistance in getting the hell out of there!
    
    Your aim is to pick up all survivors of the battle, they should be 
    easy to recognise because they are the only people left in the 
    underground caverns.
    The craft you pilot has been issued with 10 strength armour and has 
    been armed with a 40 mega watt laser, 80 watt bombs, an infra red 
    particle beam with the frequency code to open all known underground 
    gates, just enough engine power to get you off of the ground, but not 
    enough to keep you hovering.
    Specially marked landing pads have been erected for you to land 
    and pickup the last inhabitants.  
    
    Kill or avoid the enemy.
    
    You usually start from a landing pad marked with "START", once you 
    have collected or killed all the Federation 223 survivors, find and 
    land on the landing pad marked "FINISH" to advance to the next level. 
    
    *** WARNING ***
    People do die when blown away, yes the lasers have been powered up 
    to take out the enemy, but only after they have been hit a number of 
    times, it only takes 1 hit to destroy a person.

    People
    Rescue people by landing on the landing pad they are running on.
    They will automatically run towards the ship and hop in.

    Gates
    You will encounter a number of gates within the caverns, to open
    a gate, aim the Infra red beam at the sensor (middle) on the gate.
    Gates open, pause and close at different rates, don't get crunched
    between them. 
                               *** WARNING *** 
    Do not, I repeat, do not fire your laser while manouvering through 
    gates, the gates that were installed on the planet have a kick back, 
    radiation can build up, and with a powerfull laser that you have been 
    equiped with, death is imminent.
    
    Landing Pads
    Land on them to pick up stranded men or just for a coffee break.
    Make sure you have your landing gear lowered though, you can do 
    this by pressing the enter key.

    Enemy
    Kill them.
    The enemy will fire little red bullets, avoid these.
